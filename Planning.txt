Overall Planning:

Analyze DCRaw Code, as representative image processing code
    -Identify most common instructions (ISA)
    -Identify looping structures (branch prediction)
    -Identify potential parallelism
    -Identify potential memory bottlenecks, potential cache setup

Plan ISA and memory architecture
    -Potential research (memory structure)

    -Potential Research (data processing functions)

Plan overall processor layout

Do we want capability to write out to a file?
What colorspace should the GPU be working in- efficient manipulation of tuples (RGB) or quadruples (CMYK) could be very useful
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space

What bit depth do we want (assume 16 bit for future purposes)
