Overall Planning:

Analyze DCRaw Code, as representative image processing code
    -Identify most common instructions (ISA)
    -Identify looping structures (branch prediction)
    -Identify potential parallelism
    -Identify potential memory bottlenecks, potential cache setup

Plan ISA and memory architecture
    -Potential research (memory structure)
