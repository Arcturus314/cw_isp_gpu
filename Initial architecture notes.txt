Architecture Notes:

16 bit operation (bit depth)

SIMD units should be 5-wide, to represent quadruples in CMYK (perhaps only some units?)

I should include explicit instructions for matrix multiplication and dot product calculation (how wide?- see image processing routines)

Should the article contain general purpose instructions to save image files? Potentially a simpler core

Shared cache between cores?
    Working at 4k, 12 bits per color RGB provides 3 million bits = 50 MB per image- no way we can store an entire image in cache
    Can we store an entire scanline in fast on-chip memory, plus ~1 kb for image statistics?
        Scanline (4000px) takes 144000 bits = 20kb (THIS IS A LOT OF CACHE)
            For perspective: 
                Nehalem cache (at 45nm) was 64kb -> 256kb (l1 and l2)

Basic routines: for 4k 30fps operation at 100MHz
    Needs to be able to process 250 million pixels per second
    Assume 10 multiply-add instructions per pixel
